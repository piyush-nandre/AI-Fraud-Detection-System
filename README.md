# ⚙️ Tech Stack

## Programming Language

* Python

## Libraries & Frameworks

* Streamlit
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Joblib

# 🔍 Fraud Detection Logic

The system uses a hybrid fraud intelligence architecture:

### 1. Machine Learning Predictions

* Random Forest probability
* XGBoost probability
* Isolation Forest anomaly score

### 2. Rule-Based Fraud Intelligence

Additional fraud risk is calculated using:

* Large transaction amount
* Suspicious balance inconsistencies
* High-risk transaction types
* Rapid account balance drain

### 3. Final Risk Classification

Transactions are classified into:

* LOW RISK
* MEDIUM RISK
* HIGH RISK
